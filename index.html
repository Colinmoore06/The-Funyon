        <p>A local man in Wyoming woke up one morning at 4:00AM. Normally sunlight wouldn't hit his windows until maybe
            9:00 since the mountians blocked the majority of 7-9:00's sunrise. However there was light shining through
            his window, and it was <em>green.</em> Of course he was curious, was someone outside his home with some
            colorful flashlight? So he decided to put on his boots and exit the house. After circling the whole house he
            realized that the green light was from the top of a mountain. He got his walking stick and travelled up to
            the very top, where he said he encountered an alien. The alien supposedly said to him... "Glorp shnorp,
            deflorp garbley gleud shna stoob." Experts say they have no idea how to speak alien and therefor don't know
            what that means.</p>

        <p>Early morning in New York City, people bustling, rushing to work, buying a bagel from their favorite shop.
            But hold on, what is this? There, amongst the crowds a DRAGON is spotted. He is not seen blowing flames,
            destroying buildings, or eating people. He is found in a suit and tie, on his way to work, coffee and bagel
            in his hands. That's right, this just in, a dragon is a citizen of New York and works at... Chase Bank. Dun
